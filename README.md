## Phila Cultural Fund map 

Mapping the distribution of Philadelphia Cultural Fund grant funds. 

### Note
This project is not directly affiliated with the Philadelphia Cultural Fund or the City of Philadelphia.  

### Purpose

This project is part of the [OSMP2015 program] (https://codeforphilly.org/projects/open_source_mentorship_program_2015).  The purpose of the program, and this project, is to gain experience with open-source tools and civic projects.

The purpose of the Philadelphia Cultural Fund Map is to add a layer of transparency to the Philadelphia Cultural Fund's grant-making process.  While many grantmakers restrict their funds to organizations in a given geographical area (i.e. only giving to orgs in Pennsylvania or the Philadelphia region), there is only occasionally a discussion of how funds are distributed within those boundaries.

### Models

The practice of mapping grant funds is not new or uncommon.  Many foundations, particularly those with a global reach, use maps to communicate impact or illustrate areas of interest.

[The Foundation Center's Foundations Map tool] (http://maps.foundationcenter.org/home.php) is comprehensive and powerful.  It is accessible only via subscription, but some foundations make their Foundation Center map available on their websites.

Examples of Foundation Center maps include:

 *  [Charles Stewart Mott Foundation] (http://www.mott.org1/grantsandguidelines/ExploreGrants/maps)
 * [Zellerbach Family Foundation] (http://zff.org/grantmaking/)

Other examples (not using Foundations Map tool): 

 *  [FFA Environmental Grants] (http://www.communitywalk.com/map/1743255)
 *  [Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation] (http://mrbf.org/grants)
 *  [US Dept of Energy] (http://science.energy.gov/universities/interactive-grants-map/)

### Data Sources

The data set was compiled from the [Philadelphia Cultural Fund's website] (http://www.philaculturalfund.org/), grantees' websites, and their tax form 990's, which are available to the public via [Guidestar] (http://www.guidestar.org/).

### Project Status

Just gettin' started.

##Aging Out of Place?
**OSMP 2015 - A visual analysis showing the impact of gentrification on Philadelphia’s elderly population.**

As a “city of neighborhoods”, much of Philadelphia’s culture has been established by long term residents. As the city has finally begun to see a population increase, attention has been focused on the influx of millennials and young families living in (or returning to) Philadelphia. However, less analysis has been completed to determine how these current trends have impacted (or will soon impact) the city’s elderly population. 

Currently, Philadelphia ranks 12th in the nation among areas experiencing a boom in gentrification. Growth in Philadelphia has not been widespread and is limited mostly to only a few select neighborhoods, such as West, South and Lower North Philadelphia. Anecdotally, many have claimed that new development is displacing low-income and elderly residents, so this project seeks to examine what geographic patterns exists. 

The project will build upon the existing Philadelphia gentrification maps and look at the change in the elderly populations (if any) within the tracts that were identified as “gentrifying”. This project will also include other statistics about aging and end-of-life issues that could be impacted by changes in urban development, such as transportation costs, access to health care, etc.

###Definition of Gentrification
There is no agreed upon definition for gentrification. This project will utilize the existing definition from the Governing Data report (see below in sources) exploring gentrification in major metropolitan areas. As defined by that study, gentrification was measured by the following Census and American Community Survey categories:
- increased median household income
- significant growth in median home value
- improvements in educational attainment
